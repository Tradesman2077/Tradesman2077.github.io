                Welcome to my blog, here i will be showcasing some experiments in audio visual programming leading up
                 to a final project using techniques learned along the way.

                    <p class = "text">
                        In my first session i explored the javascript library P5.js. This library is great for creating art or visualisations and is by the processing foundation. They describe as a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
                        Heres an example below, utilising some of the built in functions for shapes and using random values for colurs and sizes. Get the code <a href="https://github.com/Tradesman2077/AVD_session1" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0)">here</a>.

                    <p class = "text">
                        In my next session i began experimenting with p5.play, a library built on top of p5.js allowing for sprite manipulation and animation for creating games and small animations. Its described on their website as being built for accessibility and simplicity, not performance. It is designed to be understood and possibly modified by intermediate programmers. It is not a box2D-based physics engine, it doesn't use events, nor supports 3D.

                <p class = "text">
                    P5.js has many features for image manipulation, It uses a one dimensional array for storing rgba (red, green, blue, alpha) values for each pixels which can then be manipulated. Here i created a noise filter using random rgb values. The intensity of the filter is based on the mouse position.

                <p class = "text">
                    Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
                    Here i created spaceship style shooter with simple shapes.
                    Get the code <a href="https://github.com/Tradesman2077/AVP_session3">here</a>.

                <h3 style="margin: 2%;">Experimenting Tone.js</h3>
                <p class = "text">
                    Next I began to explore the javascript library known as Tone.js. Tone.js is a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. The architecture of Tone.js aims to be familiar to both musicians and audio programmers creating web-based audio applications. On the high-level, Tone offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like a global transport for synchronizing and scheduling events as well as prebuilt synths and effects. Additionally, Tone provides high-performance building blocks to create your own synthesizers, effects, and complex control signals.
                    Here I used three oscillators and various parameters in a small angular application to make a synth drum module. This was my favourite part of the module so far and laid the foundations for my final project.
