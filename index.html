                 to a final project using techniques learned along the way.

                    <h3 style="margin: 2%;">Exploring p5.js</h3>
                    <p class = "text">
                        In my first session i explored the javascript library P5.js. This library is great for creating art or visualisations and is by the processing foundation.
                         They describe as a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else!
                          p5.js is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
                        Heres are some examples below, utilising some of the built in functions for shapes and using random values for colurs and sizes.
                         I had previously used p5.js but was a little rusty so coming back to it was a good experience to learn all the functions again. I was happy with my sketch and took inspiration from 80s artwork such as the old artwork featured by the band 'New Order'.
                          Get the code <a href="https://github.com/Tradesman2077/AVD_session1">here</a>and another sketch

                      Here is another sketch once again playing around with random placements of circles and colour values.
                       The power of p5.js for artwork is the combination of shape and colour with the power of loops and conditionals.
                       This allows huge compositions to be created with minimal effort and very few lines of code.

                    <p class = "text">
                        In my next session i began experimenting with p5.play, a library built on top of p5.js allowing for sprite manipulation and animation for creating games and small animations.
                         Its described on their website as being built for accessibility and simplicity, not performance.
                         It is designed to be understood and possibly modified by intermediate programmers.
                          It is not a box2D-based physics engine, it doesn't use events, nor supports 3D.
                          I enjoyed adapting this 'pong' style game into something different with the rotating blocks and a game score counter.
                           I have always been interested in games and it is somthing I want to explore in the future though I think p5.play is a little lacking in support and features nowadays.

                <p class = "text">
                    P5.js has many features for image manipulation, It uses a one dimensional array for storing rgba (red, green, blue, alpha) values for each pixels which can then be manipulated.
                     Here i created a noise filter using random rgb values. The intensity of the filter is based on the mouse position. Image manipulation is a fascinating area and is definatley somthing i want to return to at some point in the future.
                      The array of pixels and its manipulation in a nested loop was tricky to underrstand at first but once I began to see the changes I was making it became much clearer.

                <p class = "text">
                    Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
                    Here i created spaceship style shooter with simple shapes and composed the music using audio tracker software called renoise. As I stated earlier games programming is somthing I am interested in and Three.js is far more in depth and feature rich than somthing like p5.play. I found some of the 3D math difficult but when you create a cool effect it is very rewarding.
                     I want to continue to develop my skills in games programming and want to try using a game engine such as unity in the future.

                <h3 style="margin: 2%;">Experimenting Tone.js</h3>
                <p class = "text">
                    Next I began to explore the javascript library known as Tone.js. Tone.js is a web audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. The architecture of Tone.js aims to be familiar to both musicians and audio programmers creating web-based audio applications. On the high-level, Tone offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like a global transport for synchronizing and scheduling events as well as prebuilt synths and effects. Additionally, Tone provides high-performance building blocks to create your own synthesizers, effects, and complex control signals.
                    Here I used three oscillators and various parameters in a small angular application to make a synth drum module. The idea came from synth drum units from the 70s/80s like star instruments <a href="https://secretlifeofsynthesizers.com/synare-3/">synare</a>. This was my favourite part of the module so far and laid the foundations for my final project. I have produced music for several years and consider myself quite knowledgable on synthesis techniques, so this is a perfect fit for my interests. In my final project I want to have several of these small componants containing an instrument that can then all be sequenced together like a an old groovebox, such as those createed by companies such as Roland or Korg in the 90s/2000s.

                <h3 style="margin: 2%;">Final Project - DT-01 GrooveBox</h3>
                <p class = "text">
                    Building on my previous work I began to work on my final project, which was a more fully featured groovebox. I used my previous angular project of a synth drum module as a starting point.
                    My goal was to build a groovebox similar to japanese products from the companies yamaha and roland in the 90s/2000s man of which can be viewed <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/sequencers-grooveboxes?page=7">here</a>. These boxes were hardware grooveboxes with synthesizers and drum machines built in, usually containing a sequencer and effects.
                    I took the different oscillators and effects from Tone.js and added functionality to trigger them through phrases that are synced together. I initially created the whole groovebox within a single component, but i soon realised that the codebase was getting far too big to be contained in one class and html file.
                    I then extracted the various elements or channels into their own component, to make the code easier to read and maintain. 
                    I tried to make each channel creatively interesting and tailored the effects or features to make the palette of sounds as wide as possible. I also learned a lot from the projects that preceded this one, the oscilloscope display and the other visual elements were from my learning in lectures and 
                    the various ways of connecting up the tone instruments and effects were learned whilst working on my portfolio. 
                    I am very happy with my results from this module and I believe I pushed myself beyond what I thought I would be capable of during this module.
                     If given more time would like to try create a more fully featured sampler section allowing users to chop up samples and play them on different tracks with a waveform display to aid in the chopping process.
