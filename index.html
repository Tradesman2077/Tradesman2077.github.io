            <h3>Rmg-1 Synthesizer/sequencer built with p5.js</h3>
            <img src="pics/p5screenshot.png" class="picture">
            <p class = "text"> During my degree at Leeds Trinity University i studied web develpoment and creative coding. One of the projects I worked on during this time was a sequencer/synthesizer built using p5.js that could run in the browser. The 
                synthesizer used three lanes each with a different octave and then generated random notes played within a set scale. The design involved writing a function to transpose the notes into different scales using the formula fn = f0 * (a)n.
                 The results are definatley interesting and helped me to gain a good grasp of how the p5.js library works, along with learning HTML/CSS and javascript. Check it out <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/tradesman2017/full/iITBpmQR7">here</a>.

            <h3>Computer Science Book-Club Android app</h3>
            <img src="pics//andorid_booklub.png" class="picture">
            <p class = "text"> In my second year of university i was tasked with creating a computer science 'bookclub' application. This app was built on the android platform and was programmed using the Java programming language.
                I used firebase for my storage and programmed the whole app using java within android studio. I added the ability to upload photos for the books, search for books, had verified register and logins and reviews sections on the app. The app was fully featured and tested usign Junit and espresso.
                 I learnt object oriented programming fundamentals along with the MVC design pattern whilst working on this project aswel as gettign a solid grasp of Java and its various features and libraries.
